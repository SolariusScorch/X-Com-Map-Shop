ConfigConverter
2021 jun 11 - 2.2.2.0


ConfigConverter is a standalone utility that converts MapEdit.dat files to a
YAML file. It's not perfect/robust but it might/should output the basics of a
configuration file that can be used by MapView 2. It requires the additional
files Images.dat and Paths.pth in the directory with MapEdit.dat.

The intention is that persons who are using MapView 1 and want to try MapView 2,
but their tileset-configuration for the former is ~1000 lines and they
understandably don't want to redo all that tileset-configuring, may run their
MapEdit.dat through ConfigConverter to hopefully get a YAML config-file that's
workable with MapView 2.

usage:
[optional: Copy your MapEdit.dat, Images.dat, and Paths.pth to a directory along
with ConfigConverter.exe.] Run the converter, it's straightforward. (no, i don't
know how to make a virus, trojan, or whatever they are) The output should be
MapTilesets.yml - copy/move that file to your MapView 2 "settings" folder and
try running MapView 2.

The definition of MapTilesets.yml is written at the top of the file itself, in
case you want to review/edit it by hand. Note: YAML is editable as plaintext,
but never use a tab character in YAML.

Other than that, this folder is deletable in toto.
