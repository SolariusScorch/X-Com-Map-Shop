MapView ii

2020 feb 22

major rewrite of the original MapView by Ben Ratzlaff aka DaiShiva (and others)

MapView is a map and routes editor for XCOM UFO/TFTD. It nominally requires the original UFO/TFTD resources, such as PCK/TAB/MCD files. It can edit pre-existing MAP and RMP files, and create new ones from scratch.

REQUIREMENTS:
32/64-bit Windows OS, .NET 4.5.1, ~2 MB disk installation, XCOM Resources

A converter utility, ConfigConverter, is included that might/should be able to convert a MapEdit.dat file, which is used for MapView 1, into a MapView 2 configuration file for tilesets. MapView 2 uses YAML to save most if not all settings; MapView 1 uses a custom parser.

Not all MapEdit.dat files will convert gracefully. The design of how tilesets load, store, and access their configurations has changed substantially. Instead of loading/storing tilesets under a group and subgroup, the group and category of a tileset is now stored within the tileset definition itself. A default resource folder is assigned upon installation, for either or both UFO and TFTD, which is typically the parent-path of the MAPS, ROUTES, and TERRAIN folders of your stock XCOM installation(s). However, if you prefer to use a scratch directory for editing tilesets, tilesets can be created (or manually copied) into an arbitrary folder of your choice, as long as it is a parent folder that has the subfolders MAPS and ROUTES for the .MAP and .RMP files respectively.

That would then become a tileset's "basepath". See the CHM helpfile's Configuration page for further details, as well as the header doc in MapTilesets.yml.

MAKE BACKUPS OF ALL YOUR STUFF. i mean it. Stuff being your MAPS and ROUTES, mostly.

PckView is included as a spriteset editor and a very simple sprite editor - it can be used to create/edit/save PCK/TAB files.

McdView is included as a partset editor - it can be used to create/edit/save MCD files.

ps. I don't have TFTD so that's largely untested.
