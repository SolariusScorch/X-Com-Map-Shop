major rewrite of the original MapView by Ben Ratzlaff aka Daishiva (and others)

MapView is a map and routes editor for XCOM UFO/TFTD. It nominally requires the
original UFO/TFTD resources, such as PCK/TAB/MCD files. It can edit pre-existing
MAP and RMP files, and create new ones from scratch.

PckView is included as a spriteset editor and a very simple sprite editor - it
can be used to create/edit/save PCK+TAB files.

McdView is included as a partset editor - it can be used to create/edit/save MCD
files.


REQUIREMENTS:
32/64-bit Windows OS, .NET 4.5.1, ~2 MB disk installation, XCOM:UFO and/or
XCOM:TFTD Resources

MapView2 contains 2 converter utilities:

1) RulesetConverter is a utility that converts data from an OxC/e ruleset file
to a YAML file - MapTilesets.tpl - which contains data that can be used by
MapView2.

See RulesetConverter.txt

2) ConfigConverter is included that might/should be able to convert a
MapEdit.dat file, which is used by MapView1, into a MapView2 configuration file
for tilesets. MapView2 uses YAML to save most if not all settings; MapView1 uses
a custom parser.

See ConfigConverter.txt

Not all MapEdit.dat files will convert gracefully. The design of how tilesets
load, store, and access their configurations has changed substantially. Instead
of loading/storing tilesets under a group and subgroup, the group and category
of a tileset is now stored within the tileset definition itself. A default
resource folder is assigned upon installation, for either or both UFO and TFTD,
which is typically the parent-path of the MAPS, ROUTES, and TERRAIN folders of
your stock XCOM installation(s). However, if you prefer to use a scratch
directory for editing tilesets, tilesets can be created (or manually copied)
into an arbitrary folder of your choice, as long as it is a parent folder that
has the subfolders MAPS and ROUTES for the .MAP and .RMP files respectively.

That would then become a tileset's "basepath". See the CHM helpfile's
Configuration page for further details, as well as the header doc in
MapTilesets.yml in the /settings subfolder (created during first run).


MAKE BACKUPS OF ALL YOUR STUFF. i mean it. Stuff being your MAPS and ROUTES,
mostly - but also your TERRAIN folder(s).

ps. I don't have TFTD so that's largely untested.
